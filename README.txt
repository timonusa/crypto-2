COVER LETTER
As I could understand the main idea of PoW protection is that some stuff is difficult for client to calculate
and easy for server to check.

TECHNICAL
I've done 2 variants

First is just a two files that should be started in a 2 terminals - they are working fine

Second is a docker-compose project with 2 containers when they start client connect to the server among containers and exchange messages,
but I could not enter any message in this console - maybe its connect with the way of reading etc - but still getting data from console is a training task
and I decided that I could left it.

P.S please let me know what was wrong with the task - need your feedback.

Kind regards, Tim
